This is the repository for my Final Year Project, titled Murrieta: Connected, for my BSc at the University of Roehampton London. 

**This repository is a developing prototype, so not everything is currently available.**

## Overview

This project is aimed at creating a usable bus system for the town of Murrieta, California in the United States of America. Since the current public transport infrastructure is lackluster at best, I am aiming to overhaul the current system and create a new bus system, with the routes created by algorithms for optimization. This will then be presented to the user with an interactive map and the ability to search for the best route from a selected origin and destination node.

## Company

Murrieta: Connected is a theoretical company that could be created using the information created from this project. The idea is to be able to build a realistic business model from the output of the program.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project is to build something from scratch within the time constraint of two university-length terms. This means that the project must be reasonably attainable within this time frame.

The project is to be undertaken by myself and myself only, but Scrum methods and Kanban ideology is expected to be applied throughout.

## Data

The data used in this project is a hand-collected dataset of 174 individual points throughout the city of Murrieta, California, USA based on my own personal knowledge of the city as well as official documents found on the city's official website.

## Key Features

*In Progress*

## Build Structure

The program is built upon the most current version of Python3 (as of February 2023) using .ipynb notebooks.

## Bug Reporting
If there are any bugs or issues with the program or installation, please use the issues tab located within this GitHub repository. This will make it easy for user communication with us developers, as we will be able to locate the bug(s) and try to create a solution as fast as possible.
